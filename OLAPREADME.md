# Datawarehouse Project – OLAP Operations

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook OLAPoperations.ipynb, which demonstrates key Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations used in data warehousing and business intelligence.

## Overview
OLAP operations allow analysts to interactively explore and analyze multidimensional data.  Examples of OLAP applications for decision assistance are given in this notebook, with an emphasis on:

- **Roll-up**: Aggregating data along a dimension hierarchy.
- **Drill-down**: Navigating from summary data to more detailed data.
- **Slice**: Selecting a single dimension to view a subset of the data.
- **Dice**: Selecting two or more dimensions to form a subcube.
- **Pivot (Rotate)**: Reorienting the multidimensional view of the data.

## Contents
- `OLAPoperations.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with worked examples of OLAP operations.


## Purpose
The notebook is meant to:
- Demonstrate how OLAP operations work step by step.
- Show how Python and Jupyter can be used to simulate multidimensional queries.
- Provide a learning resource for students studying **data warehousing** or **business intelligence**.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run the cells in order to see each OLAP operation applied.
3. Modify the sample data to experiment with your own scenarios.
